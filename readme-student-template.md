Initially, I tried using a HEAD request to get the content length from the server before downloading the file. My idea was to send the GF_OK header with the known length and then perform a normal GET request to stream the body. For some files, CURL returned a content length of 0, or the reported length didnâ€™t match the actual number of bytes received.

Because of these problems, I abandoned the HEAD request approach. Instead, I switched to downloading the full file into memory first, storing it in a dynamically resizing buffer. Each time libcurl received a chunk of data, the callback function would calculate the actual size of that chunk, expand the buffer using realloc, copy the new data into place, and update the total size. By the end of the download, I had a contiguous block of memory containing the entire file and an exact byte count. With this information, I could send a GF_OK header that matched the actual size of the data. After sending the header, I streamed the data to the client in a loop, tracking how many bytes were successfully sent in case gfs_send only wrote a portion at a time. 
Testing

For this is one I used detailed logging to keep track of the number of bytes that were being sent. I checked that the provided client and that the downloaded files matched the served files exactly.  

I also ran tests using gfmetrics and all requests completed successfully.
